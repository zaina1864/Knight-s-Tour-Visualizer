# ‚ôû Knight‚Äôs Tour Visualizer

A visual, interactive Python simulation of the **Knight‚Äôs Tour problem** using **lookahead algorithms**. This project demonstrates AI-inspired decision-making by simulating how a knight moves across a chessboard, visiting every square exactly once without repetition. Users can choose between 1-step and 2-step lookahead modes, enabling an engaging way to understand heuristic search strategies.

> üß† Developed as part of **AIRE305 ‚Äì Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Engineering**.

## üìå Project Overview

The **Knight's Tour** is a classic combinatorial problem where a knight must move over every square on a chessboard exactly once. This visualizer allows users to:

- Select a starting square on the board.
- Choose between:
  - **1-step lookahead:** Greedily selects moves with the most future options.
  - **2-step lookahead:** Simulates an extra depth of move possibilities to pick the most strategic path.
- Observe move sequences labeled on the board.
- View arrows representing each knight move in L-shape format.

## üîç Algorithms Used

### üü¢ Warnsdorff‚Äôs Heuristic (Modified)
A variation of Warnsdorff‚Äôs Rule is used to pick the knight‚Äôs next move:
- The knight moves to the square that has the **least number of onward moves**.
- This is enhanced by **depth-1 and depth-2 lookahead**, where we simulate future paths and rank options.

### üü° Lookahead Strategy
- **Depth 1:** For each valid move, count the number of onward moves from that square.
- **Depth 2:** For each valid move, simulate all possible next moves from that square and aggregate the total options (greedy heuristic with expanded foresight).

### üî∫ Greedy Move Selection
- Among available moves (labeled `A`, `B`, etc.), select the move with **maximum downstream mobility**.
- Tiebreakers are resolved alphabetically.

## üì∏ Visual Examples

### ‚ôüÔ∏è One-Step Lookahead Example

In this mode, the knight evaluates **all possible next moves** from its current position and picks the one with the **highest number of available onward moves**.

*Red highlights show valid moves based on one-step prediction.*

### ‚ôû Two-Step Lookahead Example

Here, the knight evaluates the **future outcomes** of each possible move, checking what options each of those leads to (like a search tree with depth = 2), and selects the move that offers the **best cumulative potential**.

*Yellow highlights indicate depth-2 move predictions, allowing smarter path planning.*
